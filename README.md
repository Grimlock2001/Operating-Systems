-----Alex Gallant Operating Systems Assignments Repository-----

This repository will be the home for all Git related assignments for my Operating Systems class

Just as a note, I will organize the repository as follows for ease of navigation:
Each WEEK on canvas will have its own branch in the repository
Each ASSIGNMENT will have its own folder in that branch with the necessary files inside them

This is to ensure no confusion as to where the assignments are, and to help keep myself as organized as possible.
